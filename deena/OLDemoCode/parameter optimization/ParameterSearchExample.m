% Examples of using the polynomialOptimization function to fit a dataset 
% with polynomials of various degrees 

xData = -20:1:20; % General x data to use throughout the tutorial 

%% Case 1 - Parabola 

%% Case 2 - Cubic Function 

%% Case 3 - Several fits for one dataset 

%% Case 4 - Upper/lower bounds and their violation 

%% Case 5 - Linear equality constraint

%% Generate data: parabola of the form 3(x-1)^2 + 2, with noise added
